# Hello, this is Hearkour


### I like to listen to others.

### I like genuine learning (when I'm not under pressure!)
<br>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [xlsx-to-quizlet](https://github.com/Hearkour/xlsx-to-quizlet) and [Hearkour-app](https://github.com/Hearkour/Hearkour-app)
  
  > Will it work well? I do not know 😉
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [세벌식390](https://typing.malangmalang.com/)

  > Very interesting layout
